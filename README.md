# SPOCRA On-Chain Voting
The purpose of this repository is to describe and outline the process of submitting ballot proposals and casting votes onto the Cardano blockchain.

While the initial intent of this outline is to allow voting for the SPOCRA organization, the functionality and packages described here should be easily adaptable to serve other purposes.
